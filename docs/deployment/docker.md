# Docker Compose

Two compose files live under `docker/`:

- `docker-compose.yml` — the **development stack**: API + worker built from
  source with hot reload, plus bundled Postgres and Redis.
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` — the **production app**: API + worker from a
  prebuilt image, no data layer. The reference for
  [deploying at your facility](production.md).

## Development stack

```bash
cd docker
cp ../.env.example .env     # optional — sensible defaults are baked in
docker compose up -d
```

This brings up four services:

| Service | Image | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `api` | built from `Dockerfile.dev` | Uvicorn with `--reload`; `src/` and `tests/` are bind-mounted, so edits apply live |
| `worker` | built from `Dockerfile.dev` | Arq worker for background jobs |
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine` | Data persists in the `canopy-pgdata` volume |
| `redis` | `redis:7-alpine` | Job queue |

Defaults (overridable in `docker/.env`): API on port `8000`
(`API_HOST_PORT`), key `dev:read+write`, `simulation` EPICS backend, debug
on. Verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl -H "X-API-Key: dev" http://localhost:8000/hare/v1/pvs/DEMO:TEMP
```

### Database migrations

Run Alembic from the **host**, pointed at the published Postgres port — the
dev image copies only `src/`, so the migration tree is not inside the
container:

```bash
CANOPY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://canopy:canopy@localhost:5432/canopy \
  uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Postgres-backed endpoints (Squirrel) return errors until this has been run
once.

### Defining facilities

Facilities are not seeded by a migration and are not read from an env var — a
facility is a row in `core.facility`, created explicitly. Nothing can reference
a facility slug that doesn't exist: a PV or snapshot write naming an unknown
slug is a 404, and minting an API key with an unknown grant is a 400.

For the dev stack, seed the SLAC hierarchy in one step (idempotent, safe to
re-run):

```bash
CANOPY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://canopy:canopy@localhost:5432/canopy \
  uv run python scripts/seed_dev_facilities.py
```

This is **dev only** — it is deliberately not wired into container startup.
Each production instance has its own database and its own hierarchy, so there
is no single baseline to seed, and re-seeding on boot would fight facilities
edited through the API. Define them individually instead:

```bash
uv run python scripts/create_facility.py lcls --name "LCLS"
uv run python scripts/create_facility.py lcls-sc --name "LCLS-II SC" --parent lcls
uv run python scripts/list_facilities.py
```

Slugs are lowercase alphanumerics with internal hyphens; `LCLS` is rejected
rather than silently lowercased. A slug is **immutable** once created — it's
what `?facility=` filters and API key grants reference — so correcting one
means deleting and recreating, which is refused while the facility has
children or while any PV, snapshot, or active key grant still references it.

An `admin` key can also manage facilities over HTTP: `POST /v1/facilities`,
`PUT /v1/facilities/{slug}`, `DELETE /v1/facilities/{slug}`. The CLI stays the
bootstrap path, since those routes need an admin key that itself may need a
facility grant.

### Using a local IOC

To point the containers at an IOC on the host, set the EPICS variables in
`docker/.env`:

```bash
CANOPY_EPICS__BACKEND=epics
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST=host.docker.internal
EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=NO
```

### Housekeeping

```bash
docker compose logs -f api      # follow API logs
docker compose down             # stop (keeps the Postgres volume)
docker compose down -v          # stop and wipe data
```

## Production compose

`docker-compose.prod.yml` runs only the app: an `api` service and two
`worker` replicas, both from the image named by `IMAGE`
(e.g. `ghcr.io/slaclab/canopy:<tag>`).

It differs from the dev stack deliberately:

- **No Postgres/Redis.** Run Postgres 16 and Redis 7 however your site runs
  databases, and point `CANOPY_DATABASE_URL` / `CANOPY_REDIS_URL` at them —
  see [Postgres and Redis](production.md#postgres-and-redis).
- **`network_mode: host`.** EPICS Channel Access / PV Access need UDP
  broadcast, which bridged container networking breaks. The API listens on
  `API_PORT` (default 8000) directly on the host.
- **All config from a sibling `.env` file.** Compose reads it for `IMAGE`
  and `API_PORT` and passes it to both services as their environment; nothing
  is baked into the image or the compose file. Write it by hand or render it
  from your secret store.

The production image is built from `docker/Dockerfile.prod` by CI on every
push to `main` and every `v*` release tag — see
[image tags](production.md#image-tags). The image also carries the Alembic
tree, so migrations run as
`docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head`.

On the host, save the file as `compose.yml` next to its `.env`, so the bare
`docker compose` commands in these docs find it. Compose doesn't pick up
`docker-compose.prod.yml` by itself, and in the repo's `docker/` directory the
same commands select the development stack. See
[Deploy at your facility](production.md#run-with-the-reference-compose-file).
