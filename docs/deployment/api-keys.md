# API keys

Every data endpoint in Canopy is gated by an API key. This page is the
operator's runbook: how to mint, list, and revoke keys, and how the two
credential layers behind the scenes fit together.

## How keys work

Every key carries three independent scopes:

- **`read`** — GET requests and WebSocket connections, plus the handful of
  POSTs that only read (Converter's conversions, Fox's evaluate/validate).
- **`write`** — endpoints that change something: setting a PV, saving a
  snapshot, storing a config.
- **`admin`** — key management (this page's own HTTP surface) and other
  operational-not-data actions, such as dropping a Vole ring buffer.

`admin` is **orthogonal**, not a level above `read`/`write` — an admin key that
cannot itself read a PV is a better credential for a provisioning tool than one
that can do everything. A `write` key cannot mint or revoke keys; only `admin`
can.

Independently, every key also carries a **module scope** and a **facility
scope** — see [Module scoping](#module-scoping) and
[Facility scoping](#facility-scoping) below.

Clients send the token in the `X-API-Key` header. WebSocket endpoints also
accept `?api_key=<token>` for browsers that cannot set headers on a WebSocket
handshake — that parameter exists purely as a compatibility workaround and is
not a convention to extend to other endpoints.

### Two credential layers

Keys resolve from two places, checked in order:

1. **Env (`CANOPY_API_KEYS`)** — a small, long-lived, statically-stable set.
   Parsed once at startup, so it keeps working even if Postgres is completely
   unreachable, including on a cold start when there is nothing cached yet.
   Checked first, so the highest-volume credential in the system — the read
   key baked into every display — never makes a database round trip.
2. **Database** — every other key: per-tool, per-user, and CI keys, and any
   `write` key. Minted and revoked without a deploy, cached briefly for
   latency, with revocation therefore not quite instant (see
   [Revocation](#revocation)).

A deployment's env layer typically holds exactly two keys — one `read` key for
displays, one `admin` key for ops — and manages everything else in the
database. The env key is not an emergency-only credential: because the display
key ends up inlined into a public JS bundle at build time (via react-trace's
`.env`), it was never going to be a fast-revocation secret regardless of where
it lived, so it's simplest to keep it as a permanent, statically-stable floor
rather than a special break-glass case.

!!! warning "Unset means locked, not open"
    If both layers are empty, no keys exist and every gated endpoint returns
    `401`. Startup logs the loaded env count — see [Verifying](#verifying-a-deployment).

!!! note "Running without a database"
    An env key works with no Postgres at all. An **unknown** token, however,
    falls through to the database registry, so with no database reachable it
    returns `503` `key_store_unavailable` rather than `401` — the store
    genuinely cannot say whether the token is valid.

## Provisioning a key

### Local development / Docker Compose

`.env` / `docker/.env` carry `CANOPY_API_KEYS`; `docker-compose.yml` defaults it
to `dev:read+write@*` when unset. Fine for a laptop, never for a shared host.
Everything else — the working set of keys for local testing — is easiest to
manage through the CLI once `CANOPY_DATABASE_URL` points somewhere real:

```bash
# Mint. -r/-w/-a add scopes; at least one is required.
uv run python scripts/create_key.py trace -r
uv run python scripts/create_key.py operator-tools -r -w
uv run python scripts/create_key.py ops-cli -a

# List (add -a for active-only).
uv run python scripts/list_keys.py

# Revoke.
uv run python scripts/deactivate_key.py <key-id>
```

`create_key.py` prints the plaintext token once — it is not recoverable, only
its hash is stored. These scripts talk to the database directly, so they work
with only `CANOPY_DATABASE_URL` set: no existing key is needed to bootstrap the
first one, which is what makes them the right tool for a fresh instance.

Without a local `uv` environment, run the same commands inside the `api`
container instead: `docker compose run --rm api python scripts/create_key.py ...`.

### Production instances

The env layer's two long-lived keys live in the instance's `CANOPY_API_KEYS`,
in the `.env` beside the production compose file (see
[configuration](production.md#configuration)):

```bash
CANOPY_API_KEYS=<display-read-token>:read@*,<ops-admin-token>:admin@*
```

Everything else for that instance — per-tool keys, CI keys — is minted with
the CLI against the instance's database, not through `.env`. The CLI ships
in the image (`Dockerfile.prod` copies `scripts/`), so run it in the running
`api` container rather than from a workstation — the instance's Postgres is
often bound to the host's `127.0.0.1` and isn't reachable from outside it:

```bash
docker compose run --rm api python scripts/create_key.py "<app>" -r
```

Rotating an env key is still a deploy; rotating anything else is a CLI call.

## Managing keys over HTTP

The same operations are available at `/v1/api-keys` on the parent app, gated on
`admin` (never `write` — see [Scope design](#why-admin-not-write) below):

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/v1/api-keys` | Mint a key. Body: `appName`, any of `read`/`write`/`admin`, and optionally `modules`/`facilities`. Returns the plaintext `token` once. |
| `GET` | `/v1/api-keys` | List keys (`?activeOnly=true`, `?appName=<name>` to filter). Never returns a token. |
| `GET` | `/v1/api-keys/count` | Count keys (`?activeOnly=true` to filter). |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/api-keys/{id}` | Deactivate a key. |

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: <admin-token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"appName": "trace", "read": true}' \
  http://localhost:<API_PORT>/v1/api-keys
```

!!! note "Deactivating the key you're using"
    `DELETE /v1/api-keys/{id}` refuses to deactivate the key that authenticated
    the request itself — `400` `api_key_self_deactivation` — since doing so
    would lock that session out mid-use. Pass `?force=true` to override, or use
    `scripts/deactivate_key.py`, which has no such guard (it isn't a request
    that can lock itself out).

### Module scoping

A key can be restricted to one or more mounted sub-apps — `mole`, `hare`,
`raccoon`, `vole`, `fox`, `squirrel`, `magpie`, `jobs`, `converter`
— or `core`, for the parent app's own routes (`/health`, `/v1/api-keys`).
Minting a key via the CLI or `POST /v1/api-keys` without naming any modules
grants every module, an explicit default of `["*"]` at that layer. There is no
such default for the env layer — see below.

This constrains which **surface** a key can call, not which **data** it can
see through that surface — a `squirrel`-scoped key can reach every route
`squirrel` exposes, the same as an unscoped key would. Restricting *which*
facility's data a key can see is a separate mechanism — see
[Facility scoping](#facility-scoping) below.

Set it with `-m`/`--module` (repeatable) on `scripts/create_key.py`, or the
`modules` field on `POST /v1/api-keys`:

```bash
uv run python scripts/create_key.py trace -r -m fox -m vole
```

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: <admin-token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"appName": "trace", "read": true, "modules": ["fox", "vole"]}' \
  http://localhost:<API_PORT>/v1/api-keys
```

For an env-layer key, the `@<module>[+<module>]` suffix is **required** — an
entry with no `@` at all is skipped as malformed, the same as an empty token.
Use `@*` for every module:

```bash
CANOPY_API_KEYS="trace:read@fox+vole,ops:admin@*"
```

A key that resolves but isn't scoped to the module a route belongs to gets
`403` `insufficient_module_access` — checked before the `read`/`write`/`admin`
scope check, so an out-of-scope, no-access key is still reported as
out-of-scope, not out-of-read.

### Facility scoping

A key can also be restricted to one or more `core.facility` slugs — a global
attribute of the key, independent of module scope. Naming a facility grants
that facility and everything beneath it in the hierarchy, the same "itself
plus descendants" rule `?facility=` filtering itself uses.

The grant itself is defined and validated here; nothing yet *consults* it. A
data-serving module (Squirrel) reading and enforcing this scope on its own
reads and writes is separate, not-yet-merged work — until it lands, a
facility-scoped key authenticates and passes module/read/write checks
normally, but every module ignores its facility grant.

Unlike module scope, an **empty** facility list is valid and meaningful — it's
the default for a newly minted key, and means "provisioned but not yet
assigned to a facility" (or "data access suspended without revoking the
credential entirely"). Minting without any `-f`/`facilities` value leaves this
empty; there is no implicit "every facility" default the way module scope
defaults to `["*"]`. Pass the wildcard explicitly (`-f '*'` or
`"facilities": ["*"]`) for a key that should see every facility's data.

Keys configured via `CANOPY_API_KEYS` are always granted every facility. There
is no env syntax for facility scope and deliberately won't be: env keys are the
statically stable floor that has to keep working through a database outage, and
resolving a facility grant requires reading the hierarchy from the database.
Restrict by facility with a database-backed key.

The rest of this section calls a key **unrestricted** if it is granted `*` or
comes from `CANOPY_API_KEYS`, and **restricted** otherwise — including a key
with an empty grant. Facility scope is independent of `read`/`write`/`admin`:
those are flags on the key as a whole, and a key's one facility list applies to
all of them. There is no "write here, read-only there."

Set it with `-f`/`--facility` (repeatable) on `scripts/create_key.py`, or the
`facilities` field on `POST /v1/api-keys`:

```bash
uv run python scripts/create_key.py trace -r -f lcls -f lcls-sc
```

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: <admin-token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"appName": "trace", "read": true, "facilities": ["lcls", "lcls-sc"]}' \
  http://localhost:<API_PORT>/v1/api-keys
```

Every slug named in a grant must already exist — a mistyped one is a `400` naming
it. A typo'd grant resolves to "matches nothing" at request time, so the key would
authenticate normally and then see and write nothing, with no error to point at the
mistake. Define the facility first (see
[Defining facilities](docker.md#defining-facilities)). `*` names no slug, so it
needs nothing defined.

For the same reason, a facility that any *active* key grants cannot be deleted:
`DELETE /v1/facilities/{slug}` is refused with `facility_in_use` until the grants
are gone. Deactivating a key releases its grants.

**Reads** are filtered, not refused. Every PV and snapshot read a restricted key
makes is filtered; there is no unfiltered read for it to fall back on:

- **PV lists** (`GET /v1/pvs`, `/paged`, `/search`) return only PVs assigned to a
  facility the key holds.
- **The snapshot list** (`GET /v1/snapshots`) returns only snapshots filed under
  a facility the key holds.
- **A single snapshot or a comparison** (`GET /v1/snapshots/{id}`,
  `/{id1}/compare/{id2}`) is a `404` if a snapshot is filed under a facility the
  key doesn't hold, so it can't be read by id either.

A request's own `?facility=` filter is intersected with the key's grant, so it
can narrow results but never widen them. A key with an empty grant gets zero
rows, and asking for a facility the key isn't granted returns nothing rather
than everything. A `?facility=` naming a facility that doesn't exist is a
`404 facility_not_found`. Tags, the device list, and meta-PVs (see below) are
global and not filtered.

**Writes** are refused, with a `403 insufficient_facility_access` — a filtered
write would silently do nothing, which is worse than an error. The rules:

- Mutating a row assigned to facilities requires the key to hold **any one** of
  them. Holding one of a PV's facilities is enough.
- A row with **no** facility assignment is writable only by an **unrestricted**
  key. No grant can cover a row that names no facility, so a restricted key —
  even one holding every facility that currently exists — is refused, the same
  way it's refused a row assigned to a facility it doesn't hold. This also
  means a restricted key can't strip a row's last facility and un-assign it:
  that write is refused outright, not silently let through because the key
  held everything the row used to be assigned to.
- Creating a *new* PV or snapshot is the parallel rule at mint time: a
  facility-restricted key must name at least one facility it holds. A
  restricted key can never mint an unassigned row — if it could, the row would
  be reachable by every other write-scoped key but not reliably by the one
  that created it, once "unassigned requires unrestricted" applies on the next
  write.
- Restoring a snapshot is gated on the snapshot's facility, the same as viewing
  it: a snapshot the key can't see is a `404`, including an unassigned one for
  a restricted key. Within a visible snapshot, any PV whose facility was
  changed after capture to one the key doesn't hold — or that has no facility
  at all — is skipped and reported in the job result's `skippedPvIds`; if every
  PV is skipped, the restore is a `403`. Update and delete gate the same
  unassigned-row rule through a different path (the row's own facility check,
  not the read-masking one), so they report `403` rather than `404` for the
  same case — both refuse the write; only the status code differs.

**Where facilities come from.** Both are set by the user. A PV's facilities (it
can have several) are assigned when it's created or edited, through `facilities`
on `POST`/`PUT /v1/pvs`. A snapshot has at most one facility, chosen when it's
taken through `facility` on `POST /v1/snapshots`, and that choice decides what it
captures: only the PVs assigned to that facility or one of its descendants, the
same set `GET /v1/pvs?facility=<slug>` returns. An `lcls` snapshot holds the
`lcls`, `lcls-sc`, and `lcls-nc` PVs, never `facet`'s. PVs with no facility are
left out. A snapshot with no `facility` captures every registered PV, and only
an unrestricted key can create one.

**Snapshot reads and restore can disagree on an old snapshot.** A snapshot
taken before facility scoping existed holds every PV's values as of capture.
If a PV held then is later reassigned to a different facility a key holds, that
key can still read the old values in the snapshot (the snapshot's own facility
gate is what's checked, not each PV's current one) but `restore` skips that PV,
since restore checks each PV's *current* facility. The read is correct as
history; only a future restore follows today's assignment.

This check and a concurrent mint aren't serialized against each other — each
runs in its own transaction with no lock between them — so a delete and a mint
of a key granted the same facility, racing within the same narrow window, could
each see the other's not-yet-committed state. In practice this needs two admin
actions targeting the same facility at nearly the same instant, which is far
outside normal operation; it isn't a guarantee against that specific race.

A related race exists between deleting a facility and a snapshot job already
queued against it: the in-use check only looks at PVs and snapshots that exist
*when the facility is deleted*, not jobs already in Redis. A snapshot job
enqueued for a facility that's deleted before the worker picks it up resolves
an empty capture scope and produces a zero-PV snapshot whose `facility_id` no
longer exists in `core.facility` — visible and repairable only by an
unrestricted key, since a restricted key's facility-filtered reads can't match
an id with no corresponding row. This is the same class of narrow,
admin-action-timed race as the one above, not a routine occurrence.

**Meta-PVs are exempt.** Which PVs are meta-PVs (shown as summary columns on every
snapshot), their display names, and whether they're active are global settings, not
facility data. Any write-scoped key can add, rename, enable, disable, or remove one,
and `GET /v1/pvs/meta` lists all of them regardless of the key's facility scope. The
meta-PV *values* shown on a snapshot follow that snapshot's own facility gate.

### Why `admin`, not `write`

Gating key management on `write` would let any write-capable client — every
tool that can set a live setpoint — mint credentials that outlive rotation of
its own key. `write` is the largest, least-controlled population of keys in
Canopy, and the wrong one to trust with provisioning. `admin` is a separate,
narrowly-held scope for exactly this and other operational actions — for the
same reason, `POST /vole/v1/_debug/evict/{pv}` (dropping a ring buffer) is
gated on `admin` too, not `write`: it's an operational action, not a data
write.

## Rotation

Overlapping keys make rotation zero-downtime:

1. **Mint** the new key (`scripts/create_key.py` or `POST /v1/api-keys`). Both
   old and new tokens are now valid.
2. **Roll clients over** to the new token.
3. **Deactivate** the old key (`scripts/deactivate_key.py` or
   `DELETE /v1/api-keys/{id}`).

`last_used_at` (visible via `GET /v1/api-keys`) is what turns "is it safe to
deactivate the old key yet?" from a guess into a query — check it before step 3
rather than picking an arbitrary overlap window.

Rotating an **env** key is still the old process: add the new token to
`CANOPY_API_KEYS`, deploy, roll clients, remove the old token, deploy again.
Keep the env layer's population small (the two long-lived keys) specifically
so this stays rare.

### Revocation

Deactivating a database-backed key (CLI or HTTP) takes effect once its cached
entry expires — the cache TTL **is** the revocation latency (`CANOPY_API_KEY_CACHE_TTL_S`,
default 60s). If Postgres itself is unreachable when you deactivate a key, the
cached entry may still be served stale for up to `CANOPY_API_KEY_MAX_STALE_S`
(default 1h) — bounded so an outage cannot keep a revoked key alive forever,
but worth knowing if a leak coincides with a database outage.

Revoking an **env** key is a deploy, same as rotation: the practical exposure
window is the length of your deploy pipeline.

## Production hygiene

Before declaring an instance provisioned:

- [ ] `CANOPY_API_KEYS` does **not** contain the `dev:read+write@*` default.
- [ ] Tokens are freshly generated per instance — not shared between DEV and a
      facility, and not shared with another SLAC app.
- [ ] Only one `admin` key exists in the env layer (for ops), and it is not
      also used as a `read`/`write` credential anywhere else.
- [ ] `CANOPY_DEBUG` is `false` (verbose errors otherwise).
- [ ] The env tokens are recorded in a secrets manager; database-backed tokens
      are recorded wherever the owning team tracks its own credentials.

## Verifying a deployment

The startup log reports what the env layer loaded, without ever printing a
token:

```
Registered 2 API key(s) from CANOPY_API_KEYS (1 read, 0 write, 1 admin, 0 module-scoped)
```

An empty env layer is not itself a problem — it just means every key comes
from the database — and logs an `INFO` line saying so rather than a warning. A
malformed entry, an empty token, or an unrecognized scope (`read+wrote`, say)
each warn and name their position, never their content:

```bash
# docker-compose.prod.yml sets no container_name; `compose logs` resolves the
# service name for you rather than requiring you to guess the container's.
docker compose logs api --since 10m | grep CANOPY_API_KEYS
```

The container's healthcheck hits `/health` every 10s, so a plain `--tail 50`
scrolls the startup summary out of view within minutes of boot — use
`--since` (anchored to the deploy time) instead, or reach for Actions ->
`Container Host Maintenance` -> `app-logs` (raise `log_tail`) if you're
working from CI rather than the host.

Then confirm end to end, from a client's point of view:

```bash
# Ungated — proves the process is up, says nothing about keys:
curl http://localhost:<API_PORT>/health

# Read-gated — 200 means the key is valid and has read scope:
curl -H "X-API-Key: <token>" http://localhost:<API_PORT>/hare/v1/health/summary

# Expect 401 {"code": "invalid_api_key", ...}:
curl -H "X-API-Key: not-a-real-token" http://localhost:<API_PORT>/hare/v1/health/summary

# Admin-gated key management — 200 with the admin token, 403 with anything else:
curl -H "X-API-Key: <admin-token>" http://localhost:<API_PORT>/v1/api-keys
```

A key with the wrong scope returns `403` with code `insufficient_read_access`,
`insufficient_write_access`, `insufficient_admin_access`, or (see
[Module scoping](#module-scoping)) `insufficient_module_access` —
distinguishing "unknown token" (`401`) from "known token, not allowed here"
(`403`).

## Known limitations

- Keys have no expiration (`expires_at`) — nothing enforces one today.
