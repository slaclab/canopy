"""Conformance suite for `PVConnector` backends.

One set of cases that every backend -- the two shipped here and any out-of-tree
``module:Class`` backend -- runs against itself, so a screen behaves the same
whichever backend serves it. A backend supplies two things:

- a **factory**: a zero-argument callable returning a fresh, unstarted connector;
- a **driver**: the test's handle on the control system behind the connector. It
  names the PVs the suite uses and changes their values from the server side.

The suite covers three value kinds (scalar, enum, waveform) and a PV that never
connects, each under the three name forms a client may send (bare, ``ca://`` and
``pva://``), plus an optional outage case for drivers that can take their control
system down and bring it back.

The module does not import pytest, so it can also run in a helper process. The
usual pytest wiring is::

    from canopy.epics.testing import conformance

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("case_id", conformance.case_ids())
    async def test_conformance(case_id, driver):
        try:
            await conformance.run_case(case_id, make_connector, driver)
        except conformance.CaseSkipped as skip:
            pytest.skip(str(skip))

`run_all` runs every case and returns the outcomes as plain data instead.
