"""Live data ingestion from Hare's PVBroker into Vole ring buffers.

Vole registers as an internal "client" of the Hare broker using the same
add_client/subscribe API that WebSocket clients use. Diff frames arrive
at ~100ms intervals; each PVValue is converted to a Sample and appended
to the corresponding ring.

Every sample is stamped with the server's receive time and an ``after_connect``
flag (an ``initial`` frame, the first sample after a disconnected entry, or a
PV's first sample at all). Disconnected entries open an outage interval on the
ring, closed by the next connected sample -- both on the receive clock. The
broker sends this channel a ``flush`` marker after every flush, empty ones
included; ``watermark_ns`` is the receive time of the newest marker, i.e. the
newest flush ingest has fully applied.

This module is guarded by try/except at import sites — it degrades
gracefully when Hare is not available (tests, standalone Mole-only mode).
