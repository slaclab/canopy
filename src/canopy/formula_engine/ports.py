"""Data-source abstraction for the Formula Engine: the one place its services reach Vole and Mole through.

The Formula Engine's services never import Vole or Mole. They depend on this ``DataSource``
Protocol, the callables declared here, and the archive types the table seed
reads, which this module re-exports from Mole (``ArchiveBlock``, the seed budget
constants and the two archive errors a seed tells apart). Vole's adapter
implements ``DataSource`` and the sample-record port; ``formula_engine_lifespan()`` injects
both into ``FormulaService`` and ``SubscriptionManager``.
