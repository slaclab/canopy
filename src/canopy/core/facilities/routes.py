"""Facility hierarchy endpoints.

Writes are ``admin``-gated for the same reason key management is (see
``core/keys/routes.py``); ``GET`` sits at ``read``, since facility *existence* isn't a
secret, which is why ``Security`` is per-route rather than on the router.

Write routes are keyed by slug — it's immutable, and it's how a facility is spelled
everywhere else (``?facility=``, key grants). ``FacilityService`` takes ids, so each
route resolves the slug first.
