    log_level : str
        Root log level name for the API and worker processes, matched case-insensitively.
        An unknown name falls back to ``INFO`` with a warning.
    database_url : str
        Postgres DSN using the asyncpg driver.

        Connections kept in the SQLAlchemy pool.

        Connections the pool may open beyond ``database_pool_size``.
