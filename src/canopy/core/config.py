    Attributes
    ----------
    debug : bool
        Include verbose error detail in responses.
    api_keys : str
        API-key registry string, ``"<token>:<scope>[+<scope>][,...]"``.
    log_format : {"text", "json"}
        Line format for every log handler; ``"json"`` is what the Promtail scraper parses.
    log_path : str | None
        Optional file sink alongside stdout, rotated by size; ``None`` means stdout only.
    log_level : str
        Root log level name for the API and worker processes, matched case-insensitively.
        An unknown name falls back to ``INFO`` with a warning.
    database_url : str
        Postgres DSN using the asyncpg driver.
    database_pool_size : int
        Connections kept in the SQLAlchemy pool.
    database_max_overflow : int
        Connections the pool may open beyond ``database_pool_size``.
    redis_url : str
        Redis DSN backing the Arq job queue and per-job progress.
    role : {"primary", "mirror"}
        ``"mirror"`` makes this instance a read-only copy of a primary's data: write
        and admin routes refuse with ``read_only_instance`` (API-key management
        excepted) and the worker registers only stateless tasks.
    instance : str | None
        Name of the deployment this process belongs to (e.g. ``"site-a"``), reported
        by ``GET /v1/instance``.
    history_url : str | None
        Base URL of the read-only history instance holding this instance's full
        history, reported by ``GET /v1/instance`` so clients can link to it.
    window_days : int | None
        Days of history this instance keeps; ``None`` means it keeps everything.
