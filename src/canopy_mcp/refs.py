"""Ref keys for ``convert_legacy``: matching a converted parent's refs to legacy source files.

A converted parent names its sub-screens as IR refs (``embedded/_a.screen.json``);
the agent names their sources by the ref as written in the legacy file
(``siblings={'embedded/_a.bob': '/abs/path/_a.bob'}``). Both are reduced to one
KEY and matched on it:

* the RAW string is classified first -- a leading ``/``, ``~`` or ``scheme:`` is
  absolute and has no key (it is never written);
* only a relative string is normalized (``.`` dropped, ``..`` folded as the
  viewer's ``actionHost.normalizePath`` does), then a trailing ``.screen.json``
  (IR ref) or ``.bob|.opi|.edl|.ui`` (``siblings`` key) is stripped.

Where a key's draft lands (``normalize(dirname(parent_id)/key)``) and whether it
climbs above the root is decided by :func:`canopy_mcp.check.refs.resolve`,
after the join. The classification here only decides what is written; the
findings the agent sees come from ``check`` (:mod:`canopy_mcp.check.refs`
applies the same rules).
