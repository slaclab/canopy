"""Settings for canopy_mcp, read from ``CANOPY_*`` environment variables.

Every variable, its default and its meaning is in the table of the package
README (*Switches*); the comments below say only what the code needs. The names
stay flat (``CANOPY_BASE_URL``, not the ``CANOPY_<MODULE>__`` nesting the backend
modules use), and no ``.env`` file is read: the server is always launched with
an explicit environment. Two rules hold for every variable:

- An empty value counts as unset, except for ``CANOPY_BASE_URL``,
  ``CANOPY_DRAFTS_DIR`` and ``CANOPY_PV_MODE``, which must say something.
- A secret named by a ``*_FILE`` variable comes only from that file: one that
  cannot supply it raises :class:`~canopy_mcp.access.CredentialFileError`
  instead of falling back, and the PUT relay switched on without its secrets
  raises :class:`RelayConfigError`. Either way nothing is served.
