"""The identity of a collection member: ``member_key(member)``.

A member is one of two persisted shapes::

    {"screen": "<category>/<id>", "macros"?: {"<name>": "<value>", ...}}
    {"tool": "<tool id>", "query"?: "<opaque>", "name"?: "<label>"}

Its key is a string of its own grammar, never a viewer tab key:

- ``screen:<category>/<id>`` followed, when at least one macro survives, by ``?`` and the
  canonical macros;
- ``tool:<tool>`` followed, when ``query`` is present, by ``?`` and the query exactly as
  stored. An absent query (the tool's config default) and a blank one (``""``) differ:
  ``tool:trace`` against ``tool:trace?``.

The canonical macros: the names the viewer keeps for itself (:data:`RESERVED_URL_PARAMS`
and every name starting :data:`RESERVED_URL_PREFIX`; case-sensitive) are dropped, the
remaining names are sorted by Unicode code point (not by UTF-16 code unit), and each
``name=value`` pair is written with both sides percent-encoded per RFC 3986 over UTF-8:
the unreserved characters ``A-Z a-z 0-9 - . _ ~`` stay literal, every other byte becomes
``%XX`` in upper-case hex (a space is ``%20``, never ``+``). Pairs are joined by ``&``.

The screen reference, the tool id and the query are written verbatim; their own grammar
is the validator's concern. ``name`` never contributes to the key.

``fixtures/collections/member-key-vectors.json`` under ``tests/canopy_mcp`` pins this
grammar for every implementation; a member this function cannot key raises
:class:`InvalidMember`.
