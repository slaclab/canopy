"""The renderer's channel walk: which strings in a node's props it subscribes to.

A port of the rule in the runtime's ``collectPVs`` (``canopy-screen-runtime``
``packages/runtime/src/render/collectPVs.ts``): every string under a prop key
that full-matches :data:`CHANNEL_KEY`, at any depth, except under
:data:`SKIPPED_PROPS`; nothing for a node the renderer does not mount as a
widget (an ``embedded-display``, an ``unknown-widget`` or a type outside
:data:`MAPPED_TYPES`). The screen walk, the semantic check and the lint's PV
pass read it from here, so they agree on what a node subscribes to. The channel
prefixes, action types and write-capable types every walk and check compares
against are defined here too, once.

Stdlib only; imports nothing from ``canopy_mcp``.
