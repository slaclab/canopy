"""The forward of the CANOPY API: two WebSocket relays, the Mole reads, two Formula Engine POSTs and the opt-in PV write.

The served viewer reads live values over ``WS /hare/v1/ws/pvs`` and
``WS /formula-engine/v1/ws/formulas``. Both are relayed to ``CANOPY_BASE_URL`` with the
server's own ``X-API-Key`` (``CANOPY_API_KEY``) on the upstream handshake. The
upstream handshake is built from scratch -- no client header is copied and any
``api_key`` query parameter is dropped -- so a browser can neither see the key
nor substitute its own. An upstream that is not accepting connections yet is
retried for ``CANOPY_RELAY_CONNECT_RETRY_S`` seconds (default 0: one attempt)
before the browser's handshake is refused with close code 1011. A handshake from
another site (:func:`canopy_mcp.http.is_cross_site_handshake`: a cross-site
``Sec-Fetch-Site``, or an ``Origin`` other than the origins of
``CANOPY_SELF_URL`` / ``CANOPY_PUBLIC_URL`` or, on a loopback ``Host``, the
request's own origin) is refused with close code 1008 before anything goes
upstream. The ``Host`` of every request, relays included, is checked before
routing by the app's ``HostGuard``.

``GET /mole/v1/{path}`` (the Trace tab's archiver reads) is forwarded the same
way over HTTP: only ``Accept`` and the server key go upstream, ``api_key`` is
dropped, and a path that would leave ``/mole/v1/`` once decoded is a 404.

``POST /formula-engine/v1/validate`` and ``POST /formula-engine/v1/evaluate`` (read access on the Formula Engine,
used by Trace's formula curves) are forwarded under the same rules: only
``Content-Type``, ``Accept`` and the server key go upstream, ``api_key`` is
dropped, and the upstream path is the route's own fixed path, so nothing a
client encodes into it can leave ``/formula-engine/v1/``. A cross-site request
(:func:`canopy_mcp.http.is_cross_site`) is refused 403, a body over
:data:`FORMULA_ENGINE_BODY_MAX_BYTES` 413, an upstream that does not answer within
:data:`FORMULA_ENGINE_TIMEOUT` seconds is 504 ``formula_eval_timeout`` and one that cannot
be reached 502, all as ``{code, detail}``. Upstream's status, body and content
type are returned verbatim.

With ``CANOPY_PUT_RELAY`` on, ``PUT /hare/v1/pvs/{pv}`` -- and nothing else --
is relayed exactly: the raw path (no query string) after the same containment
check under ``/hare/v1/pvs/`` with a non-empty PV, only ``Content-Type`` and the
write key (``CANOPY_WRITE_API_KEY_FILE``) as headers, a body of at most
:data:`PUT_BODY_MAX_BYTES`, and upstream's status, body and content type
returned verbatim. The replies the relay makes itself are the PV-write replies of
``canopy/contracts/write_outcome_vectors.json``: a cross-site request 403, an escaping or
empty PV path 404 and an oversized body 413 are the server's own refusals
(``pv_write_refused``, nothing was sent); an upstream that does not answer within
``CANOPY_PUT_RELAY_TIMEOUT_S`` is 504 and one that cannot be reached 502, both
``pv_write_unknown``, since the write may or may not have happened.

Every other method and path under the backend's service prefixes answers 405,
in particular ``PUT /hare/v1/pvs/*`` with the relay off,
``POST /squirrel/*/restore`` and every Formula Engine path but the two POSTs above. WebSocket connections to any other path fall
through to Starlette's default, which refuses the handshake.
