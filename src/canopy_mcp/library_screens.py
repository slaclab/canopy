"""What a stored screen can write, and what it takes along when it is pushed to the library.

- :func:`list_screen_write_bindings` lists every PV one stored screen can
  write; :func:`list_write_bindings` does so for every screen of a store. The

- :func:`push_closure` lists the files a screen needs once it is copied
