"""The lazy, origin-locked headless Chromium the ``screenshot`` tool renders screens in.

Nothing launches at startup. The lifespan hook (:func:`browser_hook`) only
installs a :class:`Browser` that knows the server's own address and access
credential; the first ``screenshot`` call launches Chromium under the
browser's one lock, and an idle task stops it again :data:`IDLE_TIMEOUT_S`
after the last capture. A host without ``playwright``, without a
``playwright install chromium``, or with a ``websockets`` client that cannot
refuse redirects still starts the server: the launch fails inside the capture
and the tool answers that screenshots are unavailable.

Every capture gets its own browser context, with a route handler and a
WebSocket relay that lock the page to the server's origin: a request to any
other ``(scheme, host, port)`` is aborted, a same-origin request that is not
GET, HEAD or OPTIONS is aborted before any network call, same-origin requests
are fetched with ``X-Canopy-Access`` added for that one request and never
followed through a redirect, and same-origin WebSockets are relayed through
canopy's own ``websockets`` client with the same header, through a ``connect``
that never follows a redirect. No cookie and no context-wide header carry the
credential, so a page cannot read it or send it anywhere else.

``stop()`` bounds every step by :data:`STOP_TIMEOUT_S`; a driver that does not
answer is killed with the descendants snapshotted at launch, because a
container's ``init`` reaps only dead children, and the references are dropped
whatever the kill does, so the next capture launches a fresh Chromium.

**Sandbox.** Chromium runs without its own sandbox unless
``CANOPY_BROWSER_SANDBOX=1``: the sandbox needs user namespaces, which a
default container does not grant, and with it on there Chromium does not
start at all. The page it renders is agent-written, so a host that can grant
them (a desktop, or a container run with the namespaces allowed) should set
the switch. Without it the origin lock and the GET/HEAD/OPTIONS limit above
are what confine the page.

**Playwright internals.** :func:`_tolerate_codeless_close` reaches into
Playwright's private objects to work around a Playwright bug. It does nothing
when the attributes are gone, and ``tests/canopy_mcp/test_browser_lifecycle.py``
fails loudly when an upgrade moves them. :func:`driver_pid` finds the driver
through public process information only.
