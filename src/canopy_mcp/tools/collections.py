"""``list_collections``: every collection the viewer offers, as the agent sees it.

Read-only. The collections are the ones ``GET /collections`` lists, in the same
order (facility first, then personal, each by case-folded name, then id), read
from the same directories (``facility_collections_dir`` and
``personal_collections_dir``). Each member is checked against this host:

- a screen member (``library/<id>`` or ``drafts/<id>``) is available when the
  merged library+drafts manifest lists it, and carries ``title`` (the manifest
  title, else the member's screen reference), ``url``, the embed URL with the
  member's macros as query parameters, and ``ref`` (plus ``macros`` when it has
  any), the arguments the workspace ``open`` command takes;
- a tool member is available when this host serves the tool
  (:func:`canopy_mcp.static.configured_tools`), and carries ``label`` (its
  ``name``, else the tool's label), ``open_url: null``, and ``tool`` (plus
  ``query`` when it has one), the arguments the workspace ``open_tool`` command
  takes.

A collection's ``open_url`` is the viewer's embed root with ``_canopyOpen=<ref>``:
opening it opens every member of the collection once, arranged by its ``layout``
when it has one. ``layout`` is the stored collection layout (tiles list 0-based
member indexes in ``tabs``, sizes are weights), or ``null``.
