"""The ``request_push`` tool: file a screen, with everything it needs, for the shared library.

A push does not change the library. It writes a *bundle* into the directory
``CANOPY_PUSH_DIR`` names: one directory per request holding a copy of the
screen, of every screen it embeds or opens and of every stored image they show,
and a ``request.json`` that describes them. An administrator reviews the bundle
on the host and accepts or rejects it there. Without ``CANOPY_PUSH_DIR`` the
tool is still offered and answers ``push_unavailable``.

The bundle is cut from one consistent state of the store, and nothing slow
happens under a lock:

1. **Read.** One synchronous section in a worker thread, under the store's
   ``flock``, runs :func:`~canopy_mcp.library_screens.push_closure` on a recording
   tree. It keeps every byte string the closure read and the rev of the top
   screen, and releases the lock. The tree stops at the first file that goes
   over a size or count cap, so neither the memory held nor the time under the
   lock grows with what a draft refers to.
2. **Judge.** With no lock held, the closure runs again on a tree of exactly
   those bytes, the grammar below is applied to them, and every screen among
   them is checked (:func:`~canopy_mcp.tools.check.run_check`, which may wait
   on the PV directory). A draft saved meanwhile is neither blocked nor read.
3. **Write.** A second synchronous section, under an ``flock`` on the push
   directory, writes those same bytes as the bundle.

**Grammar.** Each member is named by its path below ``source_dir``, which is
where it lands below ``screens/<target_dir>/``:

* a screen's id matches ``ID_PATTERN`` and an image's path segments match
  ``ASSET_SEGMENT``, and no segment is a reserved one
  (:func:`~canopy_mcp.store.is_reserved_segment`, with the names of
  ``CANOPY_LIBRARY_IGNORED_NAMES``);
* an image carries one of ``PUSH_IMAGE_SUFFIXES`` (no SVG);
* at most ``MAX_ASSET_BYTES`` per file, :data:`MAX_FILES` files and
  :data:`MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` in total;
* no string anywhere in a pushed screen holds a forbidden character
  (:func:`~canopy_mcp.store.first_forbidden_pointer`);
* the paths and every directory prefix of them are unique under
  ``str.casefold()``.

**Bundle.** ``<push dir>/<rid>/files/<path below source_dir>`` for each member,
then ``<push dir>/<rid>/request.json``, written last through a temp file and a
rename, so a directory without it is an interrupted write and the next push
deletes it::

    {"format": "canopy-push/1", "rid": ..., "source_id": ..., "source_dir": ...,
     "rev": ..., "target_dir": ..., "note": ..., "created": ...,
     "files": [{"path": ..., "size": ..., "sha256": ...}, ...]}

``rid`` is 16 lower-case hex digits, ``rev`` the sha256 of the top screen's
bytes, ``created`` a UTC time (``2026-01-31T12:00:00Z``) and ``files`` is sorted
by path.

**Queue.** Every complete bundle in the push directory is a request waiting for
review; the reviewer removes it once it is accepted or rejected. A push never
deletes one: once :data:`MAX_PENDING_BUNDLES` are waiting, the next push is
refused with ``push_queue_full`` until the reviewer has worked through some.

Refusals are returned, not raised, as ``{draftId, refused: true, reason,
message, ...}``; nothing was written. ``reason`` is one of:

* ``read_only_store`` -- the id names a library screen;
* ``library_source`` -- the id's first segment is ``library``;
* ``push_unavailable`` -- no push directory is configured, or it cannot be written;
* ``push_queue_full`` -- :data:`MAX_PENDING_BUNDLES` requests are already waiting for review;
* ``closure_refused`` -- with ``refusals``, the :class:`~canopy_mcp.library_screens.Refusal`
  list of :func:`~canopy_mcp.library_screens.push_closure`;
* ``grammar_refused`` -- with ``refusals``, a list of ``{code, path, message}``
  (and ``pointer`` for ``invalid_text``, ``paths`` for ``case_collision``),
  ``code`` one of :data:`GRAMMAR_CODES`;
* ``check_errors`` -- with ``errors``, the error findings, each with the
  ``screen`` it was found in.

Bad arguments (an invalid id, ``source_dir``, ``target_dir`` or ``note``, an id
with no stored draft) raise :class:`ToolError`.
