"""The ``check`` tool: every check pass over one Screen-IR document.

A document is checked either as given (``screen``) or as stored (``draft_id``
alone). A given document may also name a ``draft_id``: its refs then resolve in
that draft's directory, as they will once it is saved there, and the stored
copy is not read. The result groups findings by pass:

* ``schema`` -- the staged Screen-IR JSON Schema (:mod:`canopy_mcp.check.schema`);
  without one, a single ``spec_unavailable`` warning and no prop lint;
* ``semantic`` -- the semantic pass plus draft-ref and image-ref resolution
  (:mod:`canopy_mcp.check.semantic`, :mod:`canopy_mcp.check.refs`);
* ``lint`` -- catalog props, in-process Formula Engine formulas and Raccoon PV lookup
  (:mod:`canopy_mcp.check.lint`);
* ``skipped`` -- checks that could not run, e.g. ``{check: 'raccoon', reason}``.

Every finding carries ``nodeId``, ``code``, ``path`` (and ``docId`` for a node
of an embedded document). Write tools call :func:`run_check` directly and gate
on the error-severity findings it returns.
