"""The ``convert_legacy`` tool: a legacy panel and its sub-screens into drafts, plus a work queue.

One call converts the parent file and the sub-screens its converted IR embeds
or opens, each through ``POST /converter/v1/conversions`` (synchronous, one
file per request), and writes them as drafts beside each other:

* **Paths.** ``path`` and every ``siblings`` source path must be absolute after
  ``~`` expansion; otherwise the call refuses, naming the key, before any
  conversion is posted. There is no allow-list: the tool reads any file the
  server's user can read and posts it to the converter, and copies images
  found beside it (limited to image suffixes and the asset grammar). Run the
  server as a user whose readable files may be shown to the agent.
* **Ref matching by key.** Each ref of the converted PARENT is matched to a
  source by key (:mod:`canopy_mcp.refs`): a ``siblings`` entry, else the default
  source ``realpath(dirname(path)/key.<kind>)`` when that file exists. A ref that
  is absolute, climbs above the drafts root, is not a valid draft id, or has no
  source is simply not written. Only the parent's refs are followed.
* **Placement and stamping.** The parent is written at ``id``, each sibling at
  ``normalize(dirname(id)/key)``; each document's ``id`` is set to its draft id
  and ``metadata.title`` to the source file stem (the last id segment for
  ``content``), so the output is byte-deterministic.
* **Revs, all or nothing.** Converted documents skip the write tools' check
  gate (the converter schema-validated them). A draft whose bytes are identical is reused
  untouched; any other existing draft needs ``overwrite=true`` and its current
  rev in ``base_revs``, else the WHOLE call refuses before any write and lists
  the conflicting ids.
* **Image copy.** After the drafts are written, every image ref
  (``image-view.src``, ``pv-button.onImage/offImage``) of every written or
  reused draft is copied from beside its legacy source into the store at
  ``screens/<relpath>``, ``relpath`` resolved against the draft's directory.
  Each ref yields exactly one ``assets[]`` entry with its status; the store
  (:meth:`DraftStore.write_asset`) is the single enforcement point. Nothing is
  raised once the drafts are committed.
* **Queue.** For every draft written or reused: ``check(draftId)`` findings
  limited to :data:`QUEUE_CODES`, plus the conversion's ``droppedProps`` as
  ``dropped_prop`` items. It is measured after the image copy, so a copied
  image leaves no ``unresolved_ref``; neither the ref classification above nor
  the copy emits queue items itself.
* **Scheme guard.** Each conversion's ``scheme`` (the color scheme the
  converter applied) is kept; the parent's is returned as ``scheme``. When
  ``CANOPY_THEME_FILE`` is set, ``overwrite=true`` refuses before any write
  unless every unit reports a ``scheme``, they all agree, it is not
  ``canopy-default``-served, carries no ``errors``, and its ``(id, sha256)``
  equal this server's own ``colorScheme.meta``: overwriting a themed draft
  with a conversion made against another scheme would silently re-color it.

    file text), with ``kind`` ``bob|edl|ui`` (inferred from ``path``'s suffix
    when omitted). ``siblings`` maps a sub-screen ref AS WRITTEN in the legacy
    file (e.g. ``embedded/_KnobDevice.bob``) to its absolute source path; a ref
    with no entry is looked for beside ``path`` as ``<ref>.<kind>``. Only the
    parent's refs are followed. Each sub-screen is written at
    ``dirname(id)/<ref>``; refs that are absolute, climb above the drafts root,
    are not valid draft ids or have no source are not written and show up in
    ``queue`` as ``unresolved_ref`` with that ``reason``.

    Converted drafts are written without the check gate. Re-running is safe:
    identical drafts are reused. An existing draft with different content needs
    ``overwrite=true`` and ``base_revs={draftId: rev}``; otherwise the whole
    call refuses, lists ``conflicts`` and writes nothing. Relative paths refuse
    naming the offending key.

    Images (``image-view.src``, ``pv-button.onImage/offImage``) are copied
    from beside each legacy source into the store next to the draft that
    references them; ``overwrite=true`` also replaces a differing stored image.

    When ``CANOPY_THEME_FILE`` is set, ``overwrite=true`` refuses
    (``reason: scheme_mismatch``, nothing written) unless every conversion
    reports the same scheme, served without errors, whose ``id`` and
    ``sha256`` match this server's.

    Returns ``{draftId, rev, url, drafts, assets, queue, scheme}``: ``scheme``
    is the converter's ``{id, sha256, served, errors}`` for the parent
    (``null`` when it reported none); ``drafts`` lists
    every draft written or reused with its ``rev``; ``assets`` has one entry
    ``{draftId, ref, path, bytes, status, detail?}`` per image ref, ``path``
    the served ``screens/...`` path (``null`` when the ref has none), ``bytes``
    the source size when known, ``status`` one of ``written``, ``reused``,
    ``replaced``, ``external`` (a URL or ``/`` ref, left alone) or a failure --
    ``missing``, ``above_root``, ``invalid_ref``, ``too_large``, ``not_image``,
    ``no_source`` (``content`` given, nowhere to copy from), ``conflict``
    (something differing is already stored there) or ``error`` -- which carries
    a ``detail``. ``queue`` is the work left for
    you, every item carrying ``draftId`` (and ``docId`` for a node of an
    embedded screen): ``check(draftId)`` findings with code ``warning``
    (converter notes; clear one with ``patch_node`` ``set:{warnings:[]}``),
    ``unknown_widget`` (with ``originalClass``; replace with ``remove_node`` +
    ``add_node``) and ``unresolved_ref``, plus
    ``dropped_prop`` items ``{nodeId, props}`` naming legacy properties the IR
    could not carry. ``dropped_prop`` names mix source vocabulary (``.bob`` /
    ``.edl`` attribute names dropped by the source adapters) and Qt vocabulary
    (Qt property names dropped by the IR builder, the ``.ui`` path). Running
