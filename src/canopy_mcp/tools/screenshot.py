"""The ``screenshot`` tool: render a draft in the server's own viewer and return a PNG.

The draft is loaded at ``/embed/drafts/<id>?<macros>`` on this process (a
library screen, tool id ``library/<id>``, at ``/embed/library/<id>``), so it
renders exactly as the agent's browser would see it, in the pv mode the
server serves in ``config.json``. Before capturing, the page gets one shared,
bounded wait (:data:`SETTLE_TIMEOUT_S`) for two things:

* ``document.fonts.ready``, so text is not captured in a fallback face;
* ``window.__canopy.pvStatus`` reaching a settled value (``connected``,
  ``disconnected`` or ``mock``). The viewer starts it at ``idle`` and moves
  through ``connecting``, so "anything but connecting" would capture a page
  that has not tried to connect yet.

If the wait runs out the screenshot is still taken: a screen whose PVs never
connect is exactly what the agent needs to see. ``pv`` then reports
``disconnected``, as it does for ``mock``: only a live Hare connection is
``connected``. Nothing is written to disk; the PNG goes back inline.

The browser (see :mod:`canopy_mcp.browser`) is launched by the first call and
locked to this server's origin; a host where no browser can run answers every
call with a tool error saying screenshots are unavailable.
