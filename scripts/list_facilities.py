"""List defined facilities and their hierarchy.

Answers "what slugs exist?" — the question to settle before minting a key with
``create_key.py -f <slug>``, since an unknown slug is rejected at mint time.
``parent`` is shown as a slug, since that's what the other CLI tools take.

Run::

    uv run python scripts/list_facilities.py
