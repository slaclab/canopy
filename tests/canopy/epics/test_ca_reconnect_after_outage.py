"""One long-lived EPICS connector across a control-system outage.

A service builds its connector once and keeps it for the life of the process.
When the control system goes away for longer than a read's timeout and comes
back, the next read on that same connector has to answer the live value: nobody
restarts the service. Each scenario here walks that sequence against a real
`EpicsConnector`: start the soft IOC, read, stop it, wait past the read timeout,
start it again, read again on the same connector.

The four Channel Access scenarios answer nothing in the recovery window without
the connector dropping its lost channels; the PV Access scenario is a guard.

This host may already serve a control system on the default EPICS ports, and a
Channel Access client keeps its channels for the life of its process. So every
scenario runs in its own helper process, whose environment confines both
protocols to loopback on ports chosen here. All ports of all scenarios are chosen
before any helper starts, so no two scenarios share one; each Channel Access
repeater port is bound here and the bound socket handed to its helper, so it is
held throughout. No repeater ever reads that socket, so the client receives no
beacons: the scenarios model a client that reaches its IOCs through
``EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST`` alone, as in a container, which is the case a beacon
anomaly cannot rescue. A failed scenario names what it measured in its
assertion message.
The scenarios run side by side, since each spends most of its time waiting.

The helper is this file, run as a script with ``--helper``.
